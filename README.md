# Dynamical Spin Injection in Low Dimensional FM/NM systems

Here we calculate the spin current generated by placing a non-magnetic 
low-dimensional system in proximity of a ferromagnet with precessing 
magnetization. The magnetization can be induced by time-dependent 
magnetic field. 

* `make_h_tau`: constructs the Hamiltonian and the hopping matrix.
* `g_lead_dec`: calculates the lead's Green's function using the decimation
  technique.
* `g_lead`: calculates the lead's Green's function using analytical formula.
* `rho_lead`: calculates DOS of site alpha using the analytical approach.

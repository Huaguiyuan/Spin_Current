# Dynamical Spin Injection in Low Dimensional FM/NM systems

Here we calculate the spin current generated by placing a non-magnetic 
low-dimensional system in proximity of a ferromagnet with precessing 
magnetization. The magnetization can be induced by time-dependent 
magnetic field. 

* `make_h_tau`: constructs the Hamiltonian and the hopping matrix.
* `g_lead_dec`: calculates the lead's Green's function using the decimation
  technique.
* `g_lead`: calculates the lead's Green's function using analytical formula.
* `rho_lead`: calculates DOS of site alpha using the analytical approach.

## Test The Code

To make sure that the initial implementation of the code is correct
what we can do is to simulate the electronic conductance of the
lattice using the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The algorithm to
calculate the Green's function of system is quite similar. The only
changes that must be apply are:

* The magnetic site must be removed, and instead a reservoir similar
  to the right side must be added.

* The spin up and down rows must be imagined as a lattice with twice
  number of sites in each slice.

* The hopping between spin up and down state (row) must be added.

After applying these changes and using the conductance formulation in
terms of the Green's function of the system, one expects to see
quantum conductance in a clean system.

The test code is implemented in `sq_Spump_test.py`.
